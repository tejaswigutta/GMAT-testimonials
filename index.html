              I found the PGA session very helpful, as I was confused between
              programs and my mentor guided me in choosing the right one. The
              communication with the team was great, and I always received quick
              responses. I found the assistance received for my CV to be the
              most useful in the entire process. The Essay review process was
              also very helpful, and CareerLabs helped me prepare for my essays
              much in advance. The entire service was very smooth and always on
              track.

              I wanted to pursue education further, I felt that just a bachelor's degree wasn’t enough. I made up my mind to pursue MBA, a fairly unique path for a person working in Sports & Journalism. I have learnt a lot in sports broadcasting and after hosting the pro-kabaddi show, I have learnt a lot about marketing and I wish to get into marketing & sports governing bodies in the long term. Krithika suggested some Math courses which turned out to be very useful for me. Within the first two versions, my CV started taking good shape, they gave me great suggestions and advice on adding volunteer work, etc. Krithika’s advice on essays was very effective, the essay process was the best part. At no point CL said that they would write for me, so the essays had my original stories and CL polished them in the right amount, helping me tell my story properly!

              For the essay drafts and CV, the response that I got from the editors was very good, and I really appreciated their feedback. Their feedback was not something that I could have thought of on my own and their advice was important for enhancing my essay. Overall, I think they helped me in writing a better essay and that must certainly have had an impact on me getting an offer.
